* Use dd to dump in and out of persistent memory
  * out: dd if=/dev/mem skip=1024 of=dump bs=1048576 count=1024
  * in: dd if=dump of=/dev/mem seek=1024 bs=1048576 count=1024
* Use ssh from host to control VM

what we have:
* comment out broken plugins to build panda properly
* no one has responded to my message....
* set up ssh-ing into vm, now accessible from host port 2222
* sent mail to qemu list for restoration version of pmemsave
  * alternatively, since I have ssh access, can do pmem saves and restores purely through ssh
  * scp program, image into vm
  * run `ssh -p 2222 root@localhost <dump/restore>`

what we have:
* ability to capture writes to pmem from live vm

what we want:
* given a live vm
  * write and restore a given pmem state
    * can be done with plugin_cmd (but it doesn't seem to work?)
    * pmemsave?
  * run arbitrary commands inside the vm

possible workflow:
* run all nova tests, capture writes to pmem using writetracker
* reboot vm/reinit pmem
  * permute and epoch
  * for each permutation
    * restore pmem state
    * check valid

end status:
* asking panda-users about missing plugin-cmd command
