what we have:
* ability to capture writes to pmem from live vm

what we want:
* given a live vm
  * write and restore a given pmem state
    * can be done with plugin_cmd (but it doesn't seem to work?)
    * pmemsave?
  * run arbitrary commands inside the vm

possible workflow:
* run all nova tests, capture writes to pmem using writetracker
* reboot vm/reinit pmem
  * permute and epoch
  * for each permutation
    * restore pmem state
    * check valid

end status:
* asking panda-users about missing plugin-cmd command
